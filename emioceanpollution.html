<h1>Why Care?</h1>
<h2>Causes</h2>
<p>There are two types of pollution: point source and non-point source. The main point source dischargers are factories and oil spills while non-point source pollution comes from runoff. </p>
<h3>Effects</h3>
<p> Chemicals used in industries are washed into the rivers and then carried into the oceans. Since the chemicals are not dissolved, they are ingested by small animals which are then eaten by the larger animals, affecting the entire food chain. Humans are also a part of this food chain and these toxins can lead to cancer, birth defects, and long term health problems. </p>
